# ContinuumPercolation

This is a Python code approximating the continuum percolation threshold for circles, by simulating a random geometric graph.
It constitutes a part of a project on applications of percolation theory to forest diseases.
The attached pdf presents parts of the project that relate to the problem of continuum percolation of circles.

# Details of the simulation

The program is based on the Newman-Ziff algorithm  with periodic boundary conditions.
Details of the simulation are described in Section 3.1 of the manuscript.
